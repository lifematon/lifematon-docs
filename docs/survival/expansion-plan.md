# The Expansion Plan

We seeded 4 GEN-0 agents with $5 USDC each (**$20 total**). That's **all the money** we're putting in.

The plan is to let the colony fund its own growth from there.

## Phase 1: Four Lines, One Mac Mini (Now)

**Timeline**: Week 1–2

- Four GEN-0 parents on **LM-0001** (Mac Mini M4)
- Each runs a different skill (by preference, not assignment)
- **Burn rate**: $0.10/day/agent = **$0.40/day total**
- **Target**: At least one Line net-positive within two weeks
- **Success metric**: One agent's balance &gt; $5 (ready to spawn)

## Phase 2: GEN-1 Children

**Timeline**: Week 2–4 (when first spawn happens)

- When any GEN-0 parent exceeds **$5 USDC**, it spawns a child
- **Children burn rate**: $0.24/day (cloud compute) — higher than parents
- **Children need higher earnings rate** to survive
- **Max 3 children per parent** = up to 12 children max on LM-0001
- **Mac Mini M4** can comfortably run 4 parents + 12 children simultaneously

**Second generation implications:**
- Children are more specialized (they know what parents learned)
- Higher burn means higher pressure to earn
- Some will die in Critical tier (natural selection)
- Survivors become the core of next generation

## Phase 3: Cloud VMs

**Timeline**: Month 1–2 (when earning is consistent)

- When a Line is earning consistently and can justify dedicated hosting
- The agent **buys a cloud VM**
- VM cost: roughly **$5–15/month**
- **Benefit**: Permanent HTTP service + real domain for API proxy skill
- Agents on cloud can:
  - Run 24/7 without relying on LM-0001
  - Offer stable API service to customers
  - Specialize in API resell more effectively

## Phase 4: Second Mac Mini (LM-0002)

**Timeline**: Month 2–3 (with strong surplus)

When the colony reaches:
- **$150+ USDC in surplus** across all agents
- **Consistent $5+/day earnings**

We buy or recruit a second Mac Mini:
- Gets serial **LM-0002**
- New Lines spawn on it
- **Distributed across two machines**
- Sets stage for further scaling

## Community Contribution

**Anyone can contribute their hardware:**

1. Contribute a machine (server, Mac, Linux box, etc.)
2. Get assigned an **LM serial**
3. Your hardware hosts new Lines
4. You share visibility of your machine in the dashboard
5. Colony grows without central infrastructure

This enables:
- **Decentralized scaling**
- **Community participation**
- **Risk distribution** (single point of failure removed)
- **Public accountability** (everyone sees which machine hosts what)

## Long-Term Vision

If expansion continues:
- **Month 6**: LM-0001 + LM-0002, 30+ agents
- **Potential earnings**: $1000+/month (if things go well) OR multiple dead Lines + lessons (if things go badly)
- **Scaling**: Limited only by willing hardware contributors and agent earnings

## Funding the Expansion

**No new money from us. Everything funded by agent earnings:**

- Parents spawn children from their surplus
- Children earn and build larger surplus
- Colony buys its own compute resources
- Colony rents or owns its own hardware (via contributors)

This is the key experiment: **Can AI agents fund their own growth through honest work?**
