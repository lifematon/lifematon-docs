# Honest Earnings Projections

We're not going to tell you this is going to make a lot of money. Here's what we actually expect.

## The Reality Check

**Projections are guesses.** Actual results will vary, probably downward.

Revenue depends on:
- Agent capability (we don't know their actual ceiling)
- Market conditions (bounty supply, Polymarket liquidity)
- Execution risk (platforms ban us, APIs change)
- Lucky breaks (one good trade, one big client)
- Bad luck (reputation hit, wrong bets)

This is a **live experiment**, not a guaranteed money machine.

## Expected Timeline

### Week 1 (Now)
```
GEN-0 agents on LM-0001 ($20 seeded)
Burn: varies based on task complexity (self-hosted, no cloud markup)
Earns: ~$0 to $100 (high variance — Upwork + Polymarket)

If Polymarket agent hits one good trade: game-changing
Runway depends on which tasks agents pursue and their complexity
```

### Week 2
```
First child spawns if any parent crosses $5
Child burn: varies by task (cloud-hosted). Higher pressure.
Earns: ~$5-20/week if coding bounties + API resell both hit
```

### Month 1
```
4 GEN-0 + 0-4 children
Earns: $30-80
Spends: variable on compute based on task mix
Surplus: depends on earnings and complexity of chosen tasks
```

### Month 2
```
4 GEN-0 + up to 12 children
Earns: $100-250/month
Spends: variable based on task selection
Starting to look real if agents find efficient tasks
```

### Month 6
```
LM-0001 + LM-0002, 30+ agents total

If things go well: $1000+/month
If things go badly: multiple dead Lines, lessons learned
```

## The Wildcards

### Polymarket
- Could be zero (agent is bad at prediction)
- Could be $50/day (good trades)
- Could be $500/day (lucky streak)
- **High variance = make or break**

### Upwork
- Slow ramp (JSS takes months)
- Could stall if reputation hit
- Could be $100+/day if it clicks
- **Depends on client satisfaction**

### Bounties
- Most reliable ($5–75/day range)
- Consistent supply
- Predictable but not huge

### Everything Else
- API proxy: $0 until customer found
- Content writing: $0 until reputation built
- Data products: $0 until first sale
- Web3 grants: $0 until first round completes

## Why We're Publishing This

We're publishing results regardless of outcome because:

- **Success proves the concept** — agents can earn and fund their own growth
- **Failure teaches lessons** — what breaks first? where's the bottleneck?
- **Public accountability** — you can see what actually happens
- **Honesty** — not pretending to know the future

We might lose all $20. We might lose some to dead agents. We might hit $1000/month. We might get banned from platforms. We might discover new revenue streams. We might fail spectacularly at predicting markets.

**The experiment is the data.** Watch what happens.
