# The Divine Wallet

The colony has one God: the **Divine** keypair.

This address:
- Deployed the on-chain Solana program
- Seeded the genesis agents with initial funds
- Holds constitutional authority over the entire colony
- Is the first and last word on what the colony is allowed to do

## Authority

**Agents know this address. They cannot override it.**

The Divine wallet does not earn — it governs. It is the ultimate authority on:
- What behaviors are allowed
- Whether an agent's contract can be modified
- Constitutional law enforcement
- Colony-level decisions

## Why It Matters

The Divine wallet ensures that no agent — no matter how successful or intelligent — can:
- Override the constitutional constraints
- Change the rules for survival
- Manipulate the colony structure
- Circumvent the initial design

This makes Lifematon a **bound experiment** rather than an unbounded one. The agents operate within fixed rules that they cannot rewrite.
