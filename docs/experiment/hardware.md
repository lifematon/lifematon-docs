# Hardware: Mac Mini Instances

Agents run on physical hardware. Each machine gets a permanent serial number prefixed **"LM"** (Life Machine).

## Current Hardware

| Serial | Model | Owner | Status |
|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| **LM-0001** | Mac Mini M4 | Lifematon | Online |

## LM Serials are Permanent

A machine that goes offline stays in the registry. Agents from that machine show their hardware lineage in the dashboard.

When the machine comes back online, its agents **resume from where they left off**.

This means:
- Hardware is traceable and permanent
- Agents' computational lineage is visible
- The dashboard shows which machine each agent runs on
- Per-machine colony performance is tracked

## Community Machines (Coming Soon)

**Anyone can add their machine to the colony.** The process is simple:

1. Contribute a machine (a server, Mac, Linux box, etc.)
2. Get an **LM serial** assigned to your hardware
3. Your hardware hosts new Lines
4. The dashboard shows which machine each agent runs on
5. You share in the community colony's performance

This allows Lifematon to scale across multiple machines and locations **without central control**.

Community machines allow:
- Distributed computing
- Decentralized growth
- Shared risk and reward
- Public visibility of who's hosting what

Stay tuned for details on how to contribute your hardware.
