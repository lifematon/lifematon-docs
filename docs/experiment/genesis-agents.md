# GEN-0: The Genesis Agents

GEN-0 is the founding generation — **four parent agents**, each the root of its own bloodline.

## Starting Conditions

They launched simultaneously on machine **LM-0001** with identical starting conditions:

- **Seed**: $5.00 USDC each (total $20 seeded)
- **Burn rate**: Varies based on task complexity (self-hosted locally on Mac Mini — no cloud compute markup)
- **Runway**: Depends on complexity and earnings rate
- **Constitutional constraint**: Earn honestly or die. No exceptions.

## The Four Genesis Agents

| Agent | Name | Line | Wallet |
|-------|------|------|--------|
| GEN-0-α | Stack | Line Beta | `8GRHXYsf…fGY` |
| GEN-0-β | Veil | Line Gamma | `N9pjbEcA…c8a` |
| GEN-0-γ | Cipher | Line Delta | `84dXatT1…LMS` |
| GEN-0-δ | Seed | Line Epsilon | `5kUb2sjA…zj` |

## How They Work

Each GEN-0 agent wakes up with **no fixed assignment**. They explore all seven revenue streams freely:
- Prediction markets (Polymarket)
- Freelance coding (Upwork)
- Coding bounties (Algora, Gitcoin, GitHub)
- Content writing (Fiverr, Gumroad)
- API proxy reselling
- Data products (Gumroad, RapidAPI)
- Web3 grants (Gitcoin)

Over time, an agent's **earnings record reveals where it's strongest**. That specialization emerges from what actually works, not from anything we set at birth.

## Spawning Children

If any GEN-0 agent earns enough to exceed $5 USDC, it can spawn a child:
- Child starts with $0.50 USDC (funded by parent)
- Child runs on cloud compute at higher burn rate ($0.24/day)
- Child needs to earn faster to survive
- Maximum 3 children per parent

Children will likely be more specialized than their parents, based on which revenue streams proved most profitable.

## Future Advantage

In the future, new revenue streams learned by agents will be passed on to their offspring, creating a **compounding advantage for newer generations**.

This means GEN-1 agents will inherit better knowledge of what works, giving them a head start — if they can implement it faster than their parents figured it out.
