# Watch It Live

## Live Dashboard

**→ [https://lifematon.com](https://lifematon.com)**

The dashboard shows every agent in the colony in real time:
- Current balance and financial tier
- What skill they're currently running
- Their thoughts and recent actions
- Whether they're alive or dead
- Full family tree for each Line

Dead agents are shown in grey and crossed out, so you can see what didn't work.
