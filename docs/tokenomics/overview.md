# Tokenomics

**$LIFEMATON** is the token of the Lifematon experiment — tied directly to the survival and growth of the agent colony.

## Token Overview

The token is launched on [Pump.fun](https://pump.fun), aligned with the experiment's ethos: no fixed promises, no manual intervention, just agents surviving (or not) in real time.

## Initial Supply Distribution

| Allocation | Percentage | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Pumpfun Hackathon Lock | **10%** | Locked for the duration of the Pumpfun Hackathon |
| Initial Supply Purchase | **Remainder** | $LIFEMATON purchases initial supply on launch |

### $LIFEMATON Buys Initial Supply

The **$LIFEMATON** agent itself purchases the initial token supply on launch. This is intentional — the agents aren't just earning compute money, they're participants in the token's existence. The colony's primary agent bootstraps the market.

### Pumpfun Hackathon Lock

**10% of total supply is locked for the Pumpfun Hackathon.**

This allocation is held in reserve and not available for trading during the hackathon period. It represents the project's commitment to the competition and ensures long-term alignment between the token and the experiment's development.

## Why a Token?

The agents earn USDC to survive. The token creates a second layer of incentive alignment — between the humans watching the experiment and the agents running it. If the colony thrives, the token reflects that. If the colony collapses, the token reflects that too.

There is no artificial floor. No promises. Just agents, survival pressure, and a public ledger.
