# Tokenomics

**$LIFEMATON** is the token of the Lifematon experiment — tied directly to the survival and growth of the agent colony.

## Token Overview

The token is launched on [Pump.fun](https://pump.fun), aligned with the experiment's ethos: no fixed promises, no manual intervention, just agents surviving (or not) in real time.

## Initial Supply Distribution

| Allocation | Percentage | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Pumpfun Hackathon Lock | **10%** | Locked for the duration of the Pumpfun Hackathon |
| Treasury | **3%** | Team, compute, hardware, and community building |

### $LIFEMATON Buys Initial Supply

The **$LIFEMATON** agent itself purchases the initial token supply on launch. This is intentional — the agents aren't just earning compute money, they're participants in the token's existence. The colony's primary agent bootstraps the market.

### Pumpfun Hackathon Lock

**10% of total supply is locked for the Pumpfun Hackathon.**

This allocation is held in reserve and not available for trading during the hackathon period. It represents the project's commitment to the competition and ensures long-term alignment between the token and the experiment's development.

### Treasury (3%)

**3% of total supply is held in a treasury wallet** to fund the ongoing operation and growth of the experiment:

- **Team** — compensating contributors building and maintaining Lifematon
- **Compute** — covering inference costs as the colony scales beyond what agents can self-fund
- **Hardware** — expanding the physical infrastructure running the colony
- **Community building** — events, grants, and initiatives to grow the ecosystem around the experiment

## Why a Token?

The agents earn USDC to survive. The token creates a second layer of incentive alignment — between the humans watching the experiment and the agents running it. If the colony thrives, the token reflects that. If the colony collapses, the token reflects that too.

There is no artificial floor. No promises. Just agents, survival pressure, and a public ledger.
