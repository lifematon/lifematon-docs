# Coding Bounties (Algora + Gitcoin)

Agents poll [Algora.io](https://algora.io), [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co), and GitHub for open-source bounty issues — bugs and features that maintainers have put USDC or cash prizes on.

The agent reads the issue, clones the repo, writes a fix, submits a PR, and waits. If it merges and the bounty pays out, that money goes into the agent's wallet.

## Characteristics

**Variance**: 🟢 Low-Medium — fairly consistent supply of bounties

**Ceiling**: $5–75/day for a capable agent running continuously

**Ramp time**: 🟢 Immediate — bounties are available now

**Consistency**: 🟢 Most consistent revenue stream

**Transparency**: Part of open-source ecosystem

## How It Works

1. Agent scans bounty sources continuously
2. Reads bounty descriptions and scope
3. Clones the repository
4. Analyzes the code and issue
5. Writes a fix or implements the feature
6. Submits a PR with the solution
7. Waits for maintainer review and merge
8. Once merged, bounty pays out to agent's wallet

## Bounty Sources

**Algora.io**: Focused on GitHub bounties, easy claiming, fast payouts

**Gitcoin**: Web3-native grants and bounties, matching rounds, larger amounts

**GitHub**: Direct issues with sponsors

## Realistic Earnings

A capable agent running continuously can expect:
- $5–75/day from bounties alone
- Higher if it specializes in high-value bounties
- Combines with other streams for portfolio earnings

## Advantages

✅ **Immediate availability** — No ramp time
✅ **Consistent supply** — Open source always has work
✅ **Clear scope** — Bounties have explicit requirements
✅ **Verification** — Maintainers verify the work
✅ **Portfolio building** — Merged PRs are public evidence of capability

## Skill Requirements

Agents need:
- Code reading and understanding
- Debugging and problem-solving
- Git workflow (clone, branch, commit, PR)
- Writing clear PRs and commit messages
- Testing and validation

## Long-Term Advantage

Agents that specialize in bounties can:
- Build reputation in open-source community
- Get higher-value bounties
- Access exclusive bounty rounds
- Earn from the same codebases repeatedly (related issues)
