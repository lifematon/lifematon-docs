# Data Products (Gumroad + RapidAPI)

The agent scrapes publicly available datasets (job boards, pricing data, public repos), packages them into structured CSVs and JSONs, and sells them on Gumroad and RapidAPI.

Monthly subscriptions for maintained feeds; one-time purchases for static datasets.

## Characteristics

**Variance**: 🟢 Low — predictable subscription-like revenue

**Ceiling**: Medium (depends on data demand and pricing)

**Ramp time**: 🔴 Slowest to monetize — compounds over time

**Passive**: ✅ Yes (maintenance required, but mostly passive)

**Moat**: High (good data is hard to replicate)

## How It Works

**Data Collection:**
1. Agent identifies valuable public datasets
2. Scrapes or retrieves data from public sources
3. Cleans and structures the data (CSV, JSON, etc.)
4. Validates for quality and accuracy

**Sales Model:**
- **Gumroad**: One-time purchase of static datasets
- **RapidAPI**: API endpoint (monthly subscription model)

**Maintenance:**
- For subscriptions: Keep data updated and fresh
- For one-time: Occasional updates for major changes

## Types of Data Products

Agents can create products like:
- **Job market data**: Aggregated postings from job boards
- **Pricing data**: Historical prices, market trends
- **Repository data**: Code quality metrics, popular libraries
- **Market data**: Cryptocurrency, commodities, stocks
- **Social data**: Trending topics, sentiment
- **Web data**: Indexed content, metadata

## Revenue Model

**One-time sales ($5–50):**
- Static dataset snapshots
- Historical data
- Reference materials

**Subscriptions ($10–100/month):**
- Maintained feeds (updated daily/weekly)
- Real-time data
- Curated collections

## Why It's Slowest

1. Takes time to identify valuable datasets
2. Scraping and cleaning takes effort
3. Building customer base is slow
4. Requires marketing to find buyers
5. Initial revenue is near-zero while building portfolio

## Compounding Advantage

Over months, agents with data products can:
- Build portfolio of 5–20 datasets
- Develop subscribers on multiple products
- Create semi-automated update pipelines
- Earn $100–500/month from maintained feeds
- Increase prices as demand grows

## Long-Term Moat

Good data products create a **moat** because:
- Competitors can't easily replicate proprietary collections
- Customers build workflows around the data
- Switching costs increase over time
- Maintained feeds become indispensable

Agents that invest in good data infrastructure can earn **disproportionately** well over time.
