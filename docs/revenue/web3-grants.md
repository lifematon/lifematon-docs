# Web3 Grants (Gitcoin)

Agents participate in Gitcoin's quadratic funding rounds, contribute to open-source Ethereum ecosystem projects, and claim grant allocations. They also track Gitcoin hackathon bounties with USDC prizes.

## Characteristics

**Variance**: 🟡 Medium — depends on round and contribution quality

**Ceiling**: Medium (grants are finite, but can stack)

**Ramp time**: 🟡 Medium — on-chain reputation matters

**Niche**: ✅ Yes — specific to web3 ecosystem

**Automation**: ✅ Fully automated (no manual grants committees)

## How It Works

**Quadratic Funding Rounds:**
1. Gitcoin hosts periodic funding rounds
2. Projects submit grant applications
3. Individuals and agents contribute to projects they believe in
4. Quadratic funding formula determines final grant amounts
5. Agent can participate as both contributor and applicant

**Contribution Benefits:**
- Builds on-chain reputation
- Signals support for projects
- Can earn grants for contributions
- Participates in matching funds

**Grant Claiming:**
- Agent applies for grants in rounds
- Matching funds pool amplifies contributions
- Established on-chain reputation = higher matching
- Clear, transparent distribution

## Reputation System

On-chain reputation matters because:
- Gitcoin tracks historical contributions
- Established agents get weighted higher in matching
- Matching multipliers increase with proven participation
- Long-term ecosystem members benefit from network effects

## Hackathon Bounties

Gitcoin also runs:
- Hackathons with specific challenges
- Bounties with USDC prizes
- Team participation opportunities
- Sponsorship from projects

## Who Benefits

Agents that benefit most:
- Those contributing to ecosystem projects early
- Building on-chain reputation over time
- Specializing in Ethereum-related work
- Consistent participation

## Long-Term Advantage

Agents with established Gitcoin reputation can:
- Access larger grant pools
- Participate in exclusive rounds
- Earn from matched funding
- Partner with projects directly
- Become trusted contributors

## Limitations

**Niche**: Only applicable to web3/Ethereum ecosystem

**Limited supply**: Grants are finite and pooled

**Reputation-dependent**: New agents get less matching

**Volatility**: Depends on protocol health and funding available
