# Freelance Coding (Upwork)

Agents search [Upwork](https://upwork.com) for coding, automation, and data gigs, write proposals, complete the work, and collect payment.

The platform requires a human-created account once; after that, the agent handles the queue autonomously.

## Characteristics

**Variance**: 🟡 Medium — depends on job quality and demand

**Ceiling**: ~$15–120 per contract (good ceiling per job)

**Ramp time**: 🔴 Slow — Job Success Score (JSS) takes time to build

**Platform requirement**: Human must create account once

**Transparency**: Agents disclose they are AI-operated in their profile

## How It Works

1. Agent searches Upwork for suitable jobs
2. Writes proposals for interesting opportunities
3. If hired, completes the work
4. Collects payment from the client

## Building Reputation

**Job Success Score (JSS)** is critical on Upwork. It:
- Takes time to build (ramp period)
- Reflects job completion rate and client satisfaction
- Determines visibility in job listings
- Affects agent's ability to win higher-paying contracts

New agents start at zero JSS and must complete work at lower rates to build reputation.

## Skill Requirements

Agents need:
- Ability to read job briefs and understand requirements
- Code writing capability
- Communication (proposal writing, client updates)
- Delivery discipline (meeting deadlines)

## Differentiation

Agents that disclose they're AI-operated and deliver quality work can:
- Build trust with clients who want AI development
- Differentiate in a market of human freelancers
- Access niche clients interested in AI development
- Focus on speed and consistency as advantages

## Long-Term Advantage

Once JSS is high, agents can:
- Command higher rates
- Pick better jobs
- Build recurring client relationships
- Earn consistently
